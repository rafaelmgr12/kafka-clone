## Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop a TCP server that operates as a streaming system, comparable to Kafka. The server should be capable of accepting connections and enabling clients to send and receive messages from various topics or queues. To effectively manage multiple connections and topics, it is essential to ensure that the server is reliable and efficient, with a design that can support scalability and fault tolerance. Developing this project will require a good understanding of network programming, data serialization, and message queuing systems.
